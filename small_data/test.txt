Unilab
,
which
provides
clinical
laboratory
services
,
competed
with
Central
,
based
in
Tarzana
,
Calif.
,
in
a
number
of
areas
.

Beyond
removing
a
competitor
,
the
combination
should
provide
``
synergies
,
''
said
Fred
Harlow
,
Unilab
's
chief
financial
officer
.

It
also
will
hand
Unilab
new
markets
.

In
Los
Angeles
,
for
example
,
Central
has
had
a
strong
market
position
while
Unilab
's
presence
has
been
less
prominent
,
according
to
Mr.
Harlow
.
